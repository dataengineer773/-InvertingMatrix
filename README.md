We want to calculate the inverse of a square matrix, The solution is Use NumPy’s linear algebra inv method, The inverse of a square matrix, A, is a second matrix A–1
, such that, where I is the identity matrix. In NumPy we can use linalg.inv to calculate A–1 ,  if it exists. To see this in action, we can multiply a matrix by its inverse and the result is the identity matrix.
